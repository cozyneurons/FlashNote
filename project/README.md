#### Description:
FlashNote is a terminal based flashcard application,ispired by Anki that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things smarter, not harder.

You can:
- Add custom flashcards directly from the command line
- Review cards that are "due" today based on spaced repetition intervals
- Mark cards as correct or incorrect to affect when you’ll see them next
- Track learning progress over time, all stored in a CSV file
- And it also gives you friendly motivational messages to keep you going during your study sessions!

This project is made using Python, and it stores everything using simple CSV files.

It uses:
- Python’s 'datetime' to figure out when a card is due for review
- File read/write to save your flashcards and progress permanently
- A basic spaced repetition system (inspired by Anki's SM-2 method) to help you remember better over time

Perfect for students, self learners, and anyone looking to make memorization actually stick.
